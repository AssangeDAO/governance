# Summary

Due to diverse opinions from the AssangeDAO community, members of AssangeDAO propose collecting community input on the Clock NFT bidding strategy. The proposal authors believe that decisions regarding the bidding strategy should be opened up to the community.

# Details

Assuming this proposal is approved by the Consensus Unit, a Snapshot governance proposal can then be created. We propose that there should only be a maximum of 4 voting options included in the Snapshot vote and have created this forum thread - to both gather sentiment on the idea from both the community and the Consenus Unit, and to gather the possible voting options.

The Consensus Unit - Jen Robinson (Julian Assange's lawyer), Gabriel Shipton (Julian Assange's brother) and Stella Moris (Julian Assange's fiancee) will review this proposal and can decide: 

1. Whether this proposal is valid and will benefit Julian Assange's defence - to allow $JUSTICE holders to decide on the bidding strategy or whether AssangeDAO should execute a "max bid" strategy without a token vote.
2. If they decide that this proposal is valid for a Snapshot vote, they can decide on the top 4 options to include in the vote.

We propose that the Snapshot vote will start on Feb 9th at 07:00 UTC and be open for 6 hours, until 13:00 UTC, giving the Gnosis Safe one hour to enact the decision of $JUSTICE holders. 

Note: To proceed with a community vote, AssangeDAO must mint $JUSTICE as soon as possible and give community members time to claim their $JUSTICE. This will enable DAO governance to be enabled before the auction for the Clock NFT closes.

# Motivation

There has been some confusion on how the Gnosis Safe should bid on the NFT.

Some community members support a "maxbid" strategy of betting the entire treasury on the NFT. However, if this happens outside the context of an organic auction, the DAO will be defunded and be hampered in achieving its objectives. Also it may put core team members at more legal risk if this strategy was acted upon alone, without a community decision.

Unfortunately, there have been some tweets or claims made about how AssangeDAO is going to participate in the auction without consultation of all members of the Gnosis Safe, and without consideration for the legal risks of the Gnosis Safe.

As such, this proposal would open the decision making process to the community. We are working on improving our workflow for public communications to reduce this confusion in the future.
