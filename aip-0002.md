# Summary

The authors propose that AssangeDAO should make $JUSTICE claimable effective immediately and invoke AIP 0001 as initial governance model.


# Details

The AssangeDAO Gnosis Safe multi-sig should make the $JUSTICE token claimable as soon as the Consensus Unit approves this action. This proposal will also invoke [AIP 0001](https://github.com/AssangeDAO/governance/blob/main/aip-0001.md) as AssangeDAO's initial governance framework, which can be updated by a $JUSTICE vote as well in the future.

# Motivation

Multiple AssangeDAO community members would like to shift power to $JUSTICE holders as soon as possible, and begin involving the community in decision making process on how the DAO is governed or operated.

To be able to act on this, it is important to have $JUSTICE tokens claimable as soon as possible, so the community has the power to propose and act on Snapshot votes.
