# Summary

Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the proposal, no more than 200 words description. If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.  

# Proposal Details

Describe in full detail what the proposal entails. It should be detailed enough to allow for it to be reasoned about by participants in the FreeAssangeDAO.   

# Motivation

The motivation is critical for proposals that want to allocate funding or change the AssangeDAO. Proposals posts without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.  

# Budget and Team

If this is a funding proposal, please include the budget and team that would be involved. If the team is not fully formed yet and you are looking for help, please describe the roles and time commitment.
