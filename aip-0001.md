# AIP Process

![AIP_process](https://assangedao.org/img/diagram_desktop.svg)

An initial governance model for AssangeDAO is shown in the diagram above, and can be ratified by our first vote and described below.

First, community members will share a draft of the proposal in the forum (https://forum.assangedao.org/) for discussion with the community. The proposal template included in the following section should be used.

Following community discussion, the proposal will be reviewed by the Consensus Unit. Their role is to screen the proposals for any potential harm to Assange or his legal case before a proposal is published on snapshot. If the Consensus Unit believes the proposal may cause harm to Assange or efforts to free Assange, they may reject the proposal from advancing. Initially, the Consensus Unit will consist of Jen Robinson (Julian Assange's lawyer), Gabriel Shipton (Julian Assange's brother) and Stella Moris (Julian Assange's fiancee) and our community moderators.

If the proposal is accepted by the Consensus Unit, it will be added to Snapshot. $JUSTICE holders will be able to vote on accepting or rejecting the proposal.

Where required, successful community proposals will be executed by the Justice Safe signers.


# AIP Template

An AIP should inlcude the following.

## Summary

Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the proposal, no more than 200 words description. If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.  

## Proposal Details

Describe in full detail what the proposal entails. It should be detailed enough to allow for it to be reasoned about by participants in the FreeAssangeDAO. If this is a funding proposal, please include the budget and team that would be involved. If the team is not fully formed yet and you are looking for help, please describe the roles and time commitment. 

## Motivation

The motivation is critical for proposals that want to allocate funding or change the FreeAssangeDAO. Proposals posts without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.
