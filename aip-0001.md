# What is an AIP?

AIP stands for AssangeDAO Improvement Proposal. An AIP is a document providing information to the AssangeDAO community, or describing a new governance proposal for the AssangeDAO or its processes or environment including technical upgrades. The AIP should provide a concise description of the proposal and a rationale.

We intend AIPs to be the primary mechanisms for governance proposals, for collecting community input on an issue, for technical upgrades, and for documenting the governance decisions that have gone into AssangeDAO. The AIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the AIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal. 

# AIP Types

There are three kinds of AIP:

* A Funding AIP describes any allocation of funding from the treasury which is used to fulfill core DAO objectives or periphery functions of the DAO such as technical infrastructure or development. They do not necessarily govern strategic objectives or wider range goals which are decided in other tracks, but can serve as precedent for later discussion other funding AIPs.
* An Operation AIP describes any fundamental technical change that affects the operation of the AssangeDAO such as a change in the execution rules, infrastructure upgrades or migration to new technical standards which may offer feature or security upgrades.
* An Informational AIP describes an AssangeDAO design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the AssangeDAO community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational AIPs do not necessarily represent an AssangeDAO community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore Informational AIPs or follow their advice.
* A Process AIP describes a process surrounding AssangeDAO in particular with wider ranging governance and strategy, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process AIPs are like Funding or Operation Track AIPs but apply to areas other than the AssangeDAO itself. They may propose a shift in strategy or focus guiding funding projects that are accepted. They often require community consensus; unlike Informational AIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in AssangeDAO daily operations. Any meta-AIP is also considered a Process AIP.

# AIP Work Flow

The AIP process begins with a new idea for the AssangeDAO. Each potential AIP must have a champion -- someone who writes the AIP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forum, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The AIP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is AIP-able. Posting to the forum.assangedao.org is the best way to go about this.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a AIP is meant to save both the potential author and the wider community time. Asking the AssangeDAO community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in fulfilling the DAOs core objectives. Small enhancements or ideas often don't need standardisation between multiple involved parties; these don't need a AIP and should be injected into the relevant AssangeDAO discussions on the community forum.

Once the champion has asked the AssangeDAO community as to whether an idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft AIP should be presented to the forum.assangedao.org community forum. This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft AIP to make it properly formatted, of high quality, and to address additional concerns about the proposal. Following discussion the AIP editors should be tagged with the final draft proposal. This draft must be written in AIP style as described below, else it will be rejected without further regard until proper formatting rules are followed.

AIP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on both the initial idea and the AIP before submitting it for review. However, wherever possible, long open-ended discussions on the community forums should be avoided. Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include: setting up a separate SIG mailing list for the topic, having the AIP author accept private comments in the early design phases, setting up a wiki page or git repository, etc. AIP authors should use their discretion here.

It is highly recommended that a single AIP contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the AIP, the more successful it tends to be. If in doubt, split your AIP into several well-focused ones.

The AIP editors assign AIP numbers and change their status. Please tag all BIP-related proposals to the AIP editor, which is listed under AIP Editors below. Also see AIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow. The AIP editor reserves the right to reject AIP proposals if they appear too unfocused or too broad.

Authors MUST NOT self assign AIP numbers, but should use an alias such as "aip-johndoe-flyinghelicopterfreedom" which includes the author's name/nick and the AIP subject.

If the AIP editor approves, he will assign the AIP a number, label it as Funding, Operation, Informational, or Process, give it status "Draft", and add it to the AIPs git repository. The AIP editor will not unreasonably deny a AIP. Reasons for denying AIP status include duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too unfocused or too broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with the AssangeDAO philosophy. For a AIP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly.

The AIP author may update the Draft as necessary in the git repository. Updates to drafts may also be submitted by the author as pull requests.

Development-focused Operation AIPs may consist of two parts, a design document and a reference implementation. The AIP should be reviewed and accepted before a reference implementation is begun, unless a reference implementation will aid people in studying the AIP.

Once a development-focused Operation AIP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be completed. When the reference implementation is complete and accepted by the community, the status will be changed to "Final".

An AIP can also be assigned status "Deferred". The AIP author or editor can assign the AIP this status when no progress is being made on the AIP. Once an AIP is deferred, the AIP editor can re-assign it to draft status.

A AIP can also be "Rejected". Perhaps after all is said and done it was not a good idea. It is still important to have a record of this fact.

AIPs can also be superseded by a different AIP, rendering the original obsolete. This is intended for Informational AIPs, where AssangeDAO changes its operating process or upgrades from an older technical operation.

The possible paths of the status of AIPs are as follows:

Some Informational and Process AIPs may also have a status of "Active" if they are never meant to be completed. E.g. AIP 1 (this AIP).

# What belongs in a successful AIP?

Each BIP should have the following parts:

* Preamble -- RFC 822 style headers containing meta-data about the AIP, including the BIP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the contact info for each author, etc.
* Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the funding, governance or technical issue being addressed.
* Copyright/public domain -- Each AIP must either be explicitly labelled as placed in the public domain (see this AIP as an example) or licensed under the Open Publication License.
* Specification -- The specification describes the detailed steps of the process such as clear descriptions of all the steps being taken and rules followed. For example a Funding AIP will describe any roadmap, deliverables and allocation of funds transferred.
* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for AIPs that want to perform any action with the AssangeDAO. It should clearly explain why the existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the AIP solves, all with the aim of fulfilling the AssangeDAO core objectives. AIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.
* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the proposal and why particular decisions were made. It should describe alternate idea that were considered and related AIPs.
* The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

# AIP Formats and Templates

AIPs should be written in markdown format.

## AIP Header Preamble

Each AIP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with "*" are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.

```
  AIP: <AIP number>
  Title: <BIP title>
  Author: <list of authors' real names and optionally, email addrs>
* Discussions-To: <forum URL>
  Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
           Withdrawn | Final | Superseded>
  Type: <Funding | Operation | Info | Process>
  Created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>
* Replaces: <AIP number>
* Superseded-By: <AIP number>
* Resolution: <url or transaction ID>
```

The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses of all the authors/owners of the AIP. The format of the Author header value must be

```
  Random J. User <address@dom.ain>
```

if the email address is included, and just

```
  Random J. User
```

if the address is not given.

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions.

The Resolution header is required for all accepted Funding Track AIPs. For all other AIPs it is optional. It contains a URL or transaction ID where the AIP was carried out.

The Type header specifies the type of AIP: Funding, Operation, Info, or Process.

The Created header records the date that the AIP was assigned a number, while Post-History is used to record the dates of when new versions of the BIP are posted to the AssangeDAO forum. Both headers should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14.

AIPs may have a Requires header, indicating the AIP numbers that this AIP depends on.

AIPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that an AIP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the AIP that replaces the current document. The newer AIP must have a Replaces header containing the number of the AIP that it rendered obsolete. 

## Auxiliary Files

AIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Image files should be included in a subdirectory for that AIP. Auxiliary files must be named AIP-XXXX-Y.ext, where "XXXX" is the AIP number, "Y" is a serial number (starting at 1), and "ext" is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. "png").

# AIP Editors

The current AIP editor is Amir Taaki who is @narodnik on the forum.assangedao.org forum.

# AIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow

The AIP editor follows AIP discussions on the forum.assangedao.org forums. All AIP-related correspondence should be appropriately tagged.

For each new AIP that comes in an editor does the following:

* Read the AIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be accepted.
* The title should accurately describe the content.
* Edit the AIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (for reST AIPs), and adherance to AssangeDAO conduct.

If the AIP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the AIP is ready for the repository it should be submitted as a pull request to the assangedao/governance repository on GitHub where it may get further feedback.

The AIP editor will:

* Assign an AIP number (almost always just the next available number, but sometimes it's a special/joke number, like 666 or 3141) in the pull request comments.
* Merge the pull request when the author is ready (allowing some time for further peer review).
* List the AIP in README.md
* Reply back to the AIP author with next steps (post to forum.assangedao.org discussion forum).

The AIP editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial responsibilities. The AIP editors monitor AIP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.
